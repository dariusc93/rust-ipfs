This contains an implementation of the [IPFS bitswap
protocol](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/bitswap/) forked from [beetle (previously Iroh)](https://github.com/n0-computer/beetle). It sends blocks of data to
other peers in the IPFS network who want them, and receives blocks requested by
the client from the network.
